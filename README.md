Java Project Starter - `ARTIFACT_NAME`
======================================

> This is a starter Java project for [ayeseeem.org](https://www.ayeseeem.org)
> Java projects.
> Copy or clone this project for a quick start to a Java project that can be
> built by Maven, aimed at Java 8+ code.
>
> If cloning, it's best to specify an origin name that won't interfere with
> your normal working procedure (and eventual remote), so something like
> `git clone --origin starter ...`
> You can also prevent accidentally trying to push back to this instead
> of your eventual remote by changing the push URL. Something like
> `git remote set-url --push starter DO_NOT_PUSH_HERE`
>
> On GitHub, this project is configured as a
> [repository template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
>
> There are various branches that will bring in other features. Use
> `git merge` to pull them in:
>
> - `with-hamcrest`
> - `licence-mit`
> - `with-GitHub-CI`
>
> Delete this section and replace with an intro to the project.
> Update the title above.
>
> Replace `ARTIFACT_NAME` everywhere - in the [POM](pom.xml), in this file,
> in the directory structure, and anywhere else it's found - with the name
> of the artifact.
>
> The sections below are a useful starting point for your project.


Coding Standard
---------------

Basic standard is [icm-java-style](https://github.com/ayeseeem/icm-java-style/).

The [POM](pom.xml) is configured with the
[Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless)
[Maven plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven)
to check/fix the basics.
